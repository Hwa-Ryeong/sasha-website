                I have been programming ever since I was 12, and in the years since then, I’ve done everything from simple one-page websites to high-performance autonomous vehicle data pipelines and advanced front-end visualization tools.  On top of this, I taught myself almost everything I know about programming, and I’ve also self-learned 9 foreign languages, so along with this huge breadth of programming experience, I also bring my extremely efficient self-learning skills.
