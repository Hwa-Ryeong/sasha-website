              <p>Woven Planet acquired Level 5 from Lyft in 2021, and I elected to join them as well.  Most of my time at Woven Planet was spent on migrating various services from Level 5’s cloud setup to Woven Planet’s - this included simple code transplants as well rewrites of several key services that couldn’t be moved.  During this time, I was the DRI for transplanting my team’s visualization tool and several components in our streaming data pipeline.  In this role, I continued to expand my skills as a full-stack engineer with ever increasing scope and impact, as my job transitioned from just writing code to managing projects, timelines, and other team members.

              <h1 class="f3 text--accent ttu">October 2019 - July 2021</h1>
              <p>I worked as a back-end infrastructure engineer at Lyft’s Level 5 Autonomous Vehicles division.  My team was responsible for maintaining data pipelines and APIs to enable engineers to efficiently process, store, and access data.  In addition, I also lead the technical development of an in-house data visualization tool that opened up access to all the data our cars collected to any team member via an easy-to-use front-end web UI.  As my first full-time job out of university, I learned a great deal about working at a large company, managing my responsibilities, navigating human relationships, and growing my skillset as an engineer.</p>

              <p>I worked here as an intern over the summer between my 3rd and 4th years of university.  My key responsibilities were maintaining and enhancing the QA suite for this startup’s front-end IoT management panel, as well as contributing bug-fixes and code reviews.  I gained practical experience in writing clean, testable code and was able to contribute and learn about the product iteration cycle.</p>

              <p>I was hired for a 2-month contract period to develop an IoT dashboard for a smart building IoT startup.  The interactive dashboard I developed was used in a trade expo to showcase their product with great success.  This was my first experience in a startup environment, and I learned a great deal about fast-paced collaboration and time management skills, as I had a very har deadline for the project I was fully responsible for.</p>
