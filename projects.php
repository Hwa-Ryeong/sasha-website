                            When I started learning Arabic, I saw that there was a distinct lack of a tool to practice reading the script. I decided to write my own app that would generate words valid according to the rules of Arabic phonology, and which would also be statistically the most common word shapes. It's written in React Native, so I gained a lot of valuable experience with the React, NPM, and Node.js ecosystem in general.

                                I needed a certain piece of UI functionality for Arabic Abjad Learner, so I created a highly configurable react-native plugin that exports a new View container to allow for slide-out panels from the top.

                            This is a website to browse through apartments the owner rents out in Portland. I built this using WordPress and customized an existing theme extensively to make it fit the needs of the client. I'm particularly proud of the integration between clickable points on the map and internal apartment entries on the website, as well as the convenient back-end portal with apartments as custom post types that make managing everything very straight-forward.

                               Around the same time that I was actively working on Design Lunatic, I got the chance to be a guest author at speckyboy.com, an online web design and development blog. I wrote several well-received guest posts, mostly tutorials on front-end technologies I was interested in at the time.
